### Theme, Epic and User Stories

#### Theme
Spark is an Irish based platform for both event promoters to showcase their local events and for potential attendees to view the local upcoming events.

#### Epic
The site allows promoters to sign up for an account and the ability to create, review, edit and delete events they want to promote. The promoter has the ability to make drafts of events before posting to the main page. The site also allows potential attendees to view the upcoming events on the main page.

### Design and UX

I chose an RGB color scheme for the logo and a main color palette of white and off-white with a dark grey footer. My aim was to create a minimalist look for the site. The RGB logo adds a bit of color and the white and off white are easy on the eyes this also leaves room for the user to add custom images without any clashing color schemes. Links and navigation have a have a blue hover color.
